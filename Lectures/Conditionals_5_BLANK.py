Let's implement a simpler version of the game "Rock, Paper, Scissors" using conditionals.
* Rock crushes Scissors
* Scissors cuts Paper
* Paper covers Rock
1. Get two inputs from the user and stored them in variables player1_choice and player2_choice
2. Compare their choices:
    Assume player 1 always chooses 'Rock'
        i.e., assign 'Rock' to player1_choice 
    When players 1 and 2 choose the same: print "It's a tie!"
    If player 2 chooses Scissors, print "Player 1 wins! Rock crushes Scissors!"
    If player 2 chooses Paper, print "Player 2 wins! Paper covers Rock!"
Use if-else and nested if-else statements.
