# Class Activities (Lecture 9)

'''
1. Ask the user to input a random word, assign it to my_string.
First, check if my_string is all uppercased. 
If yes, print out "Good, all're uppercased!".
Otherwise, convert my_string to all uppercase and print out the result.
'''




'''
2. Replace all occurrences of "coffee" with "hot chocolate" and "programmer" 
with "coder". Print out the result.
'''
paragraph = """In the town of Coderville, every programmer loved to drink coffee; 
coffee gave them the energy to code late into the night. 
However, some programmers preferred tea over coffee.""" 
# NOTE: In Python, a pair of triple double quotes like the ones above,
#   creates a multi-line string.




'''
3. Ask the user to type AT LEAST two words separated by spaces, 
    store the input to a variable named my_string.
    a. Check if the first character is capitalized (upper case), 
        if yes, print out "[user input]'s first character is capitalized";
        otherwise, print out "[user input]'s first character is NOT capitalized".
        Hint: Access the first character using indexing.
    b. Check if the first character is a number: 0 - 9,
        if yes, print out "[user input]'s first character is a number";
        otherwise, print out "[user input]'s first character is NOT a number".
    c. Print how many words in my_string
        Hint: Split my_strings by space and print the length of the list of tokens.
