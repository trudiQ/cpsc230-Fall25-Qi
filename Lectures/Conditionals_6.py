# Class Activities (Lecture 6)

'''
** Update your previous code to use if-elif-else statements instead. **
Let's implement a simpler version of the game "Rock, Paper, Scissors" using conditionals.
* Rock crushes Scissors
* Scissors cuts Paper
* Paper covers Rock
1. Get two inputs from the user and stored them in variables player1_choice and player2_choice
2. Compare their choices:
    Assume player 1 always chooses 'Rock'
        i.e., assign 'Rock' to player1_choice
    When players 1 and 2 choose the same: print "It's a tie!"
    If player 2 chooses Scissors, print "Player 1 wins! Rock crushes Scissors!"
    If player 2 chooses Paper, print "Player 2 wins! Paper covers Rock!"
'''
# write your code below
player1_choice = "Rock"
player2_choice = input()
if player2_choice == player1_choice:
    print("it's a tie")
elif player2_choice == "Scissors":
    print("Player1 wins! Rock crushes Scissors!")
elif player2_choice == "Paper":
    print("Player2 wins! Paper covers Rock!")
else: # handles invalid inputs other than R/S/P, e.g., "Flower"
    print("Invalid input. Pleas only type Rock, Scissors, or Paper.")





'''
Ask the user to input an integer and store it in the variable x.
Convert the value of x into an integer. 
Check whether the number is even and greater than 17.
If yes, print "Yes!"; otherwise, print "No."
Use if-else statement and a logical operator.
Hint: an even number can be exactly divided by 2, leaving a remainder of 0. 
'''
# write your code below
print("type a number please")
x = input() # or, you can directly do x = input("type a number please")
x = int(x)
if x % 2 == 0 and x > 17:
    print("Yes!")
else:
    print("No.")

EXTRA EXERCISE (Optional)
You are designing a system for a park to determine whether a visitor 
is allowed to enter based on their age and height.

Write a program that:
* Asks the user for their age (integer input)
* Asks the user for their height (in centimeters, float input)
* The visitor can etner the park if they are AT LEAST 10 years old
    AND AT LEAST 120.0 cm tall.
* If they don't meet both conditions, deny their entry with a message
    AND let them know the reason.
* Otherwise, print a message to welcome them!

Use if-else and logical operators (and/or) for this question.
'''
# write your code below
# Asking for user input
age = int(input("Enter your age: ")) # convert input into an integer
height = float(input("Enter your height in cm: ")) # convert input into a float

# Checking if both conditions are satisfied using 'and'
if age >= 10 and height >= 120.0:
    print("Welcome to the park!")
else:
    # Handling cases where conditions are not met
    if age < 10:
        print("You must be at least 10 years old to enter.")
    if height < 120.0:
        print("You must be at least 120.0 cm tall to enter.")

# Option 2: also works; use if-elif-else
if age >= 10 and height >= 120.0:
    print("Welcome to the park!")
elif age < 10 and height >= 120.0:
    print("You must be at least 10 years old to enter.")
elif age >= 10 and height < 120.0:
    print("You must be at least 120.0 cm tall to enter.")
else: # failed both conditions
    print("You must be at least 10 years old and at least 120.0 cm tall to enter.")
