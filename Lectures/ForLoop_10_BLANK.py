# Class Activities (Lecture 10)

'''
1. Use a for loop and range() to create integers from 0 to 5 (inclusive) and print them out.
'''
print("QUESTION 1:")
# write your code below




'''
2. Use a for loop and range() to create integers from 0 to 5 and print them out.
Use a loop variable to count iteration number and print it out after the for loop.
'''
print("QUESTION 2:")
# write your code below




'''
3. Use a for loop to iterate a list of numbers, use variable num_neg 
    to count the number of negative numbers (< 0), and print the result.
'''
print("QUESTION 3:")
numbers = [30, 20, 2, -5, -15, -8, -1, 0, 5, 35]
num_neg = 0
# write your code below




'''
4. Ask the user to input two words of the SAME LENGTH. If they give words of the same length,
use a for loop, count how many corresponding letters are the same in the two strings. 
For example in 'spam' and 'span', 3 of the letters (s,p,a) are the same. 
In the words 'bitter' and 'better',5 of the letters are the same. 
Print out a message telling the user how many letters are the same.
Hint: 
 1. Get both words' lengths and compare.
 2. Access the corresponding charaters of the same index in both words and compare them.
