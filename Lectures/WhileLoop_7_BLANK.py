0. What's wrong with this while loop and how can you fix it?
'''
# Uncomment the code below and fix it
#x = 11
#while x > 10:
#     print(x)


'''
1. Use a while loop, print out all the numbers between 1 and 10 (inclusive).
'''




'''
2. Use a while loop, iterate all the numbers from 1 to 10 (inclusive) 
and print all the numbers that are greater than 3 and less than or equal to 6.
Hint: You must use both comparision operators and logical operators.
'''




'''
3. Use a while loop, print out all the numbers between 1 and 100 (inclusive) that are
divisible by BOTH 5 and 9.
Hint: When a is divisible by b, the remainder of a/b is 0.
Recall: How to check an even number? (it is a number that is divisible by 2).

'''
4. Use a while loop, print out all the numbers between 1 and 100 (inclusive) that are
divisible by both 5 and 9.
Exit the loop when the number is greater than 50.
You must use break for this question.

5. Use a while loop, print out all the numbers between 1 and 10 (inclusive) 
EXCEPT for those which are divisiable by 3.
You must use continue for this question.
