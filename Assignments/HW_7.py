# Homework for Lecture 12
import random

'''
1. Write some code to check whether the user's input number is an even number or not. Details are below:

PART 1: Define a function, named is_even, with only one input parameter, input_num, check the input parameter to see it's an even number or not, 
    return True if it is and False otherwise.
PART 2: Ask the user to input an integer that is greater than 0, call the function you defined above and use the user input integer as the argument.
    Based on the function's output (True or False), print message "It's an even number" or "It's an odd number" accordingly.

Hint:
- You may first convert the user typed input into an integer and 
    then use that integer as an argument when calling the function.
- The function should have a return statement.

2. Write some code to ask the user to guess a random number between 1 and 10. Details are below:

PART 1: Define a function, named guess_the_number, with only one input parameter, input_num. 
    Inside the function, first, ask the user to type a number between 1 and 10 (inclusive), 
        and then compare it with the input parameter, input_num. 
    If they guess it too high, print "It's too high, try again!"; if they guess it too low, print "It's too low, try again!". 
    Continue asking them until they guess it right and print "You are right!"

PART 2: Use randint(a, b) to randomly generate an integer between 1 and 10 (inclusive) and call the function defined above with
    that random integer as its argument to see what message the function outputs.

Hint: 
- randint(a, b) is a function from a built-in library named random (see above import random)
    that can be used to generate a random integer, N, between two integers, a and b, where a <= N <= b.
    Refer to Q0 in in-class exercise for Lecture 12 for more details about how to use random.randint(a, b).
- Use a while loop with True condition inside the function definition for repeatedly asking for user input.
- The function DOES NOT have a return statement.
